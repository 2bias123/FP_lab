To generate the PDF, open the report.tex in your favorite LaTeX editor and
hit compile, or manually do this:

\begin{verbatim}
  pdflatex report
  bibtex report
  pdflatex report
  pdflatex report
\end{verbatim}

You should have stack installed (see \url{http://haskellstack.org/}) and
open a terminal in the same folder.

To compile everything: \texttt{stack build}.

To open ghci and play with your code: \texttt{stack ghci}

To run the executable generated from Section \ref{sec:Main}: \texttt{stack exec myprogram}
