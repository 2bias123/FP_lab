\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This abstract still needs to be rewritten so this is a placeholder:
    This is project explores the domain of classical cryptography by implementing and analyzing 
    a selection of historical ciphers using the Haskell programming language. 
    Our primary objective is to develop functional encoders and decoders for three classical ciphers: 
    the Caesar cipher (or substitution cipher), the Vigen\`{e}re cipher, and the Playfair cipher, 
    with the potential to expand this list based on time availability. 
    Beyond implementation, we aim to design an automated cipher recognition system capable of 
    identifying these encryption methods from ciphertext samples. Additionally, we will construct 
    tools to automatically crack the implemented ciphers, leveraging cryptanalytic techniques to 
    expose their vulnerabilities. 
    Should time permit, we will apply these tools to solve cryptography assignments provided 
    in the project description. 
    This work seeks to deepen our understanding of classical cryptographic systems while 
    showcasing Haskell’s suitability for such implementations and analyses.
